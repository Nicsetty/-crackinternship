## Caesar Cipher Program

This program implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### Functions

1. **Encryption Function (`caesar_cipher_encrypt`)**
   - **Description:** Encrypts a given text by shifting each alphabetic character by a specified shift value. Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `text` (str): The message to be encrypted.
     - `shift` (int): The number of positions each letter in the text should be shifted.
   - **Returns:** The encrypted text with each alphabetic character shifted by the given value.

2. **Decryption Function (`caesar_cipher_decrypt`)**
   - **Description:** Decrypts a previously encrypted message by calling the `caesar_cipher_encrypt` function with the negative of the shift value.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `text` (str): The encrypted message to be decrypted.
     - `shift` (int): The number of positions each letter was shifted during encryption.
   - **Returns:** The decrypted text, which is the original message before encryption.

3. **Main Function (`main`)**
   - **Description:** Prompts the user to choose between encryption and decryption. It then requests the message and shift value from the user. Based on the userâ€™s choice, it either encrypts or decrypts the message and displays the result.
   - **Usage:**
     - Run the program and select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message.
     - Enter the message and the shift value as prompted.
     - The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message accordingly.

### Example

To encrypt a message:
```plaintext
Select encryption.
Enter the message: Hello World!
Enter the shift value: 3
The output will be: Khoor Zruog!
